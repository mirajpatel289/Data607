## Introduction

The goal for this project is to transform the chess tournament data in the a text file to a R Markdown file that generates a .CSV file. The data should show Player’s Name, Player’s State, Total Number of Points, Player’s Pre-Rating, and Average Pre Chess Rating of Opponents. 

```{r load-packages, message=FALSE}

# Remove header lines and filter out empty lines
